# Youth Employment Prediction (Hackathon Project)  

🏆 **Winner of the Predictive Insights Hackathon**  
📊 Predicting youth employment outcomes with **time series**  
👥 Team: **MaBosso**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project was developed by **Team MaBosso** for the Predictive Insights Hackathon, focused on forecasting youth employment outcomes from application and employment data.  

While our model placed **3rd on the leaderboard** ([see it on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/youth-employment-prediction/leaderboard)),  
we won the overall competition by submitting the **best report** — recognized for clarity, interpretability, and actionable insights.  

In short: *the code worked, but the story worked better.*

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- 📈 Built and evaluated models using **LightGBM, Neural Networks, and Time Series methods**  
- 🔎 Designed thoughtful **feature engineering** to capture demographic and temporal patterns  
- 🧠 Balanced **prediction accuracy with interpretability**  
- 🏆 Delivered the **top report**, praised for being both technically rigorous and accessible  

---

## 📊 Methods
- **LightGBM** – leaderboard-focused, handled categorical & numeric features well  
- **Neural Networks** – experimented with nonlinear relationships  
- **Time Series Features** – extracted seasonality & lag variables  
- **Cross-validation** – ensured robust performance, not leaderboard luck

## 🏆 Results
- 🥉 **3rd place on the leaderboard** ([Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/youth-employment-prediction/leaderboard))  
- 🥇 **Winner of the hackathon** (best overall report & presentation)  
- ✅ Highlighted key socio-economic predictors of youth employment  
- ✅ Showed how explainable models can inform real-world policy
